# DailyNoteLinker
Obsidian plugin that automatically links notes you worked on to the daily note of the day it was made

## About this project:
This project is an old code project I had sitting around on my computer that I forgot I made. I figure that uploading it to github will pressure me into actually working on it again and relearning TypeScript. 

It does "work", but not very efficiently and could use some major work.

Eventually I will actaully release it and have it in the obsidian community plugin library, but for now its just a little side project
